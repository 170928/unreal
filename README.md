# UNREAL

## About

An attempt to repdroduce UNREAL algorithm described in Google Deep Mind's paper "Reinforcement learning with unsupervised auxiliary tasks."

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.05397.pdf

Work in progress. Now testing with ATARI Breakout, but the scores are lower than the A3C agent.



# TODO
- Feed previous action and current reword into LSTM in addition to the convolution layer output.
- Try using faster OpenAI's A3C implementation.
- Try DeepMind Lab environment.
